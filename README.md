# AnySoftKeyboardAddonTemplate

A template to get a working add-on for AnySoftKeyboard started quicker. This includes the ASK API files as well.

This should compile directly from the download but it is advisable to remove the intent filters and relative files that you do not plan on using.

Please be warned some of the ASK strings require a resource from values/strings and a hard coded string will fail to load.
